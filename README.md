Voxelgarden II
==============

A Game for Minetest

Forked by v-rob.


Download and Install:
---------------------

Download here: https://github.com/v-rob/voxelgarden/archive/master.zip

Unzip the archive and place the folder in your Minetest installation: minetest/games/voxelgarden.


Getting Started:
----------------

All mapgens are supported except for v6, which is only partly supported.  Ironically, that's a full turnaround from the old Voxelgarden. :)

To get started, make a world and do whatever you want.  You get a free stone pickaxe at the beginning along with a crafting guide.

After that, do what you want.  But mainly, have fun!


Notable Differences:
--------------------

Obviously, this is a lot different than both MT Game and Voxelgarden.  The main differences are:

- Magic and experience system.  This has very little using it, and I plan to add more in the future.
- Primitive tools.  Only stone and wood tools exist.
- No bones.  When you die, you keep all your stuff and don't mar your beautiful world with dead bodies.
- Items drop after you dig a node.  Walk over them or punch them to pick them up.
- No fire or TNT.  They're just annoying and the ramifications outweigh the benefits.
- Hudbars.  These look better than normal hearts, in my opinion.  Plus, you can tell how much health, experience, and mana you have easily, because mana and experience change every time you level up.
- A crafting guide.  It's a book that you get for free at the beginning of the game.  It looks somewhat like your creative inventory.
- Furniture.  There are quite a few pieces of wooden furniture, as well as a bartering table (From the currency mod)
- Weather.  Light, medium, and heavy rain, as well as snow and a new type of weather called motes.  Note: Lightning doesn't set things on fire because there is no fire.

Beside these, I've made quite a few updates to Voxelgarden.  It had many outdated things, such as the old inventory, bad crafting guide, and the old screwdriver.  Farming didn't even work.  I also replaced stairsplus with the normal default stairs.  Boats didn't exist, and beds needed updating.

There are more smaller changes, but I'm not going to name them all.  It would take too long.


Contribute:
-----------

Issues use the system of:

    bugs >> cleanups >> features >> nice to haves

Which means bugs are done first, then cleanups, than features, than the things nice to have. Every issue should be labeled with one of those.

Bigger additions should work as a mod on their own. This allows easier testing, benefits a modular design and ensure that they can still be used as a mod if the feature does not get merged.
